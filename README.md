# Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling Project

The SPIDAM project is an interactive data analysis and modeling system that loads an audio file, and subsequently cleans, analyzes, models, and displays attributes of the file; such as the waveform, a spectrogram, and frequency graphs. 

## Why SPIDAM?

The optimum reverb time for voice intelligibility is 0.5 seconds. The SPIDAM project is meant to address the problem of intelligibility in enclosed spaces as the audio used in the project was recorded in an area with an RT60 > 1 second.
