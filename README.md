# Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling Project

The SPIDAM project is an interactive data analysis and modeling system that loads a **wav or m4a file**, and subsequently cleans, analyzes, models, and displays attributes of the file; such as the waveform, a spectrogram, and frequency graphs. 

## Why SPIDAM?

The optimum reverb time for voice intelligibility is 0.5 seconds. The SPIDAM project is meant to address the problem of intelligibility in enclosed spaces as the audio used in the project was recorded in an area with an RT60 > 1 second.

## Funtionality
Install the model, view, controller, mvc, and silence.wav files into your ide. Then, navigate to the mvc file and run. Use the load button to upload a wav or m4a file to be analyzed.
